Northcoders is a bootcamp designed for individuals seeking a career as a software developer and can be based from either the Manchester and Leeds hubs or online. The bootcamp is a 12 to 14 week course delivered across four teaching blocks, comprising:

- **Fundamentals** – introducing students to the course and providing an understanding of the fundamentals and best practices of programming.
- **Back End** – students are taught how to use Node.js to run code for the back-end and programming. This part of the course also introduces APIs and databases, and covers Express and SQL.
- **Front End** – students are taught about DOM and how to make accessible websites with semantic HTML and responsive CSS, and introduces UX and React.
- **Project Phase** – the final phase in the course enables students to put their learning into practice as part of a green-field team project.
  Following completion of the course, graduates are provided with one to one sessions with dedicated career advisors.

Northcoders continually evaluates the content of its bootcamp curriculum to ensure graduates are leaving the course with sought-after coding skills and are best-positioned for software-related job vacancies.
