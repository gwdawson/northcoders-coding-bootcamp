## Setup Instructions

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account because you will be pushing your own solutions to it.

2. Clone your fork of this repository to your local machine and `cd` into it:

```
$ git clone <your fork's URL>
$ cd be-katas
```

3. Make sure you've navigated into the folder and install all dependencies using `npm install`. You also have access to an npm script to run tests (`npm test`). Work through the problems in order. Each week you should move on to the next section regardless of how far you were with the previous one. It will give you the edge when you come to do tech tests for your job applications.

4. Work on the kata and commit changes as needed. When you are happy with your solution, push all your changes to your forked repo. You should push to your fork frequently and write informative commit messages. Try to get into good habits of writing commit messages that describe the change you made in the present tense. A handy way of writing concise messages is to complete the sentence `this commit will <insert message here>`

```
$ git push origin main
```
