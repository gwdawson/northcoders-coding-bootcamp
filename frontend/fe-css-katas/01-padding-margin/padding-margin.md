# padding-margin

## Tasks

### 1. Default margin/padding

Even though there is no padding or margin applied in the css file there's a gap around the emojis... those vases are expensive and will break

Use your web browsers developer tools to inspect the elements and find which element type has some _default_ margin/padding applied. Style the element to remove the gap.

> before...

<img src="./wireframe-1.png" alt="inline vs block before" width="400"/>

> after...

<img src="./wireframe-2.png" alt="inline vs block before" width="400"/>

### 2. `margin`

Using `margin` create the following pattern.

You can use absolute or relative units here

> before...

<img src="./wireframe-3.png" alt="inline vs block before" width="400"/>

> after...

<img src="./wireframe-4.png" alt="inline vs block before" width="400"/>

### 3. Find your centre

Breathe in... and breathe out... ğŸ§˜

Help the spa-goer (ğŸ§˜) find their centre using `margin`.

They must remain centred even as the window is resized!

### 4. Style the article

We have an article which has all the content it needs but everything has its default margins and padding and it looks very cramped!

Using `padding` and `margin` _only_

- Add some whitespace
- Line up the bullet points with the article text
- Centre the buttons, add some space between them and make them a little bigger!

> before...

<img src="./wireframe-5.png" alt="inline vs block before" width="700"/>

> after...

<img src="./wireframe-6.png" alt="inline vs block before" width="700"/>
