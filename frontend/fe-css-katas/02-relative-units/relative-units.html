          Albert Einstein was a German mathematician and physicist who developed the special and general theories of
          relativity. In 1921, he won the Nobel Prize for physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. In
          the following decade, he immigrated to the U.S. after being targeted by the German Nazi Party.

          Einstein is known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the
          development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars
          of modern physics.
