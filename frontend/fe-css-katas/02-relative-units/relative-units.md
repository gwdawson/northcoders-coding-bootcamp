# Relative-units

In CSS, relatively length units are units that relative in size to something else, e.g - the size of their parent element.

### Types Of Relative Units in CSS

- em
- rem
- vh
- vw
- line-height

There are a few others however these are the ones we will use for this kata!

## TASKS:

We have created a small information card about the master of relativity himself, **Albert Einstein**, however a few things need to be amended! Don't forget to open with the Live Server extension to view the changes you make as you save your files

### Task 1:

The font in the bio section is looking a little small. The default font size for text in a HTML document is 16px. Using the **rem** unit, put it back to the default font size.

### Task 2:

Oh no!! Something has happened to our text... it has become all jumbled up and is now very difficult to read. Using **line-height** , let's see if we can make this text more readable! (hint... line-height is generally 20% larger than the current font size!)

### Task 3:

Now that we have our paragraphs sorted, it seem that the quote items are a little too big! Using the **em** unit, let's change the font size to the default equivalent of 16px

### Task 4:

Phewwww... okay so for the final task, let's make the yellow container fit the whole page as the white around the sides isn't that pretty! Using **vh** and **vw** units, lets alter the height and width of the container, so that it covers the whole page.

> NB - We have highlighted on the relative-units.css where to make your changes. Don't worry about any styling you do not yet understand as this will be covered in subsequent katas.
