# Northcoders Fundamentals Katas

## Running Order

The running order for this block's katas is:

1. `dnaPairs` - we have created the test file for this one for you
2. `getTweetData` 
3. `calculateDivisors` 
4. `tillAddition` 
5. `changeCalculator` 
6. `sentenceToCamelCase` 
7. `foldString` 
8.  `pigLatin`
9.  `morseCode` 
10. `rotateArray` 
11. `herdTheBabies` 

## Instructions

Each kata should be completed with full TDD.

## Initial Setup Instructions

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account because you will be pushing your own solutions to it.

2. Clone your fork of this repository to your local machine and `cd` into it:

```
$ git clone <your fork's URL>
$ cd fun-katas
```

## Setting up Jest

3. You will need to ensure you create a `package.json` with the command `npm init -y`

4. You will need to install any dependencies (Jest in this case) using the `npm install -D jest` command. (The `-D` flag adds jest as a `devDependency` as it is only needed for local development and testing.)

5. You will need to update the `scripts` section of your `package.json` so you can use the `npm test` command to run tests using `jest`. (You can choose to use the `--watch` flag in this command so Jest will watch your files for changes and then re-run the tests automatically)

Work on the katas and commit changes as needed. Push all your changes to your forked repo. You should push to your fork frequently but as a bare minimum please make sure it's up to date with last week's kata solutions before the next week:

```
$ git push origin main
```
