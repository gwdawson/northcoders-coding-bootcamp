  "description": "These katas are designed to make you think about building functions that are **pure** and part of this means creating functions without _side effects_ so they don't for example mutate the data they are passed as arguments. Functions that have _side effects_ can expose you to bugs that are often difficult to find, so avoiding side effects as soon as possible is a very good habit to get in to from the beginning.",
